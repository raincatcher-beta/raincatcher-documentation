[[overview]]
== Overview

Raincatcher is a set of templates and a field workforce management (WFM) application that connects a business' back-office with its fleet of mobilized employees.  Raincatcher leverages mobile hardware, making use of each employee's mobile phone.

[[raincatcher-structure]]
== Raincatcher Structure

Raincatcher consists of a set of reusable modules that are designed to be included in your application using [browserify](http://browserify.org/). Raincatcher modules are packaged and distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and export one or more of:

* Angular.js directives or services providing client-side functionality
for both the mobile and portal clients.
* Express.js routes providing a REST API to be consumed by the
client-side portions of the module.
* FeedHenry sync configurations for enabling data synchronization of a
module’s data.

Refer to the READMEs of the respective modules for details on their
purpose and consumption.

In addition to this, a demo application is provided as a project template that showcases how these modules can be assembled into an application. See [this guide](the-raincatcher-demo-solution-architecture) for the demo application architecture.

RHMAP provides a set of Raincatcher project templates to help you get
the Raincatcher demo apps up and running.
